LiveBTC
=======
An android live wallpaper for tracking bitcoin prices.

Currently, this is designed pretty poorly relative to using the BitcoinAverage API. I'd like to redesign it, but this is really more of a personal project that I threw together for fun and I rushed through most of it.

However, this app is on the Google Play Store [here](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=me.nickpierson.livebtc).
